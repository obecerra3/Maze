online maze where everydbody starts at the center and the game saves their progress. It should take like 1 month or so of deidcated work to get out of the maze.

there is pubg voice chat so players can tell other players about the path that they have travelled up to that point - either to deceive or to help.

people could leave notes around the maze (maybe they fade over days/hours). 

procedural generation of the maze

u know u reached the border but not the end

we should record the whole game to be played back later

show a percentage of the maze that has been explored up to that time + leaderboard + metrics (cool metrics, like in ready player one)

center room shows stats

sound adjustment based on physical surroundings, people make sounds when the bump into walls, you can hear super faintly through walls

on your journey, u need to follow sounds and murmurs in order to find more advanced players to get information about the surroundings or more directions
